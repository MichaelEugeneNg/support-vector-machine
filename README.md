# Support Vector Machine
Implementations of an SVM model for MNIST and Spam email classification

This repository contains 3 files:
1. **linear_svm.py**: this file was used to
  - visualize hard-margin SVMs on the toy-data.npz dataset
2. **featurize.py**: this file was used to
  - perform feature engineering on a corpus of emails to return a feature vector for each email
4. **cs189_hw1.ipynb**: this Jupyter Notebook file contains all the code used for
  - data partitioning and evaluation metrics
  - hyperparameter tuning 
  - k-fold cross validation to find the optimal C-value to use in the SVM
  - code for MNIST and SPAM kaggle competition
